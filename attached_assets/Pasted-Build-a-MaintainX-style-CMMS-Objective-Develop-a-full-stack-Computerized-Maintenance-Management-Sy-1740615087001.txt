Build a MaintainX-style CMMS

Objective:
Develop a full-stack Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) similar to MaintainX with work order tracking, asset management, preventive maintenance, and real-time updates. Follow a structured, step-by-step development approach.
üõ†Ô∏è Development Approach

You will build the CMMS system in structured phases:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Initialization (Week 1)

    Set up the project using React.js (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend).
    Use PostgreSQL as the database, Redis for caching, and AWS S3 for file storage.
    Implement Docker for containerization and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Deliverables:

    Repository structure
    Environment configuration files (.env)
    Basic API server setup
    Frontend boilerplate with React + Tailwind CSS

2Ô∏è‚É£ User Authentication & Authorization (Week 2-3)

    Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
    User roles: Admin, Manager, Technician, Vendor, Viewer.
    Secure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) using policies.
    Set up OAuth with Google & Microsoft login (for enterprise use).

Deliverables:

    /api/auth/register (User registration)
    /api/auth/login (Login & JWT issuance)
    /api/auth/refresh (Token refresh endpoint)
    UI: Login, Register, Forgot Password pages

3Ô∏è‚É£ Core CMMS Features - Work Order Management (Week 4-6)

    Create, assign, track, and update work orders.
    Work order statuses: Open, In Progress, Completed, Canceled.
    Work orders have: Title, Description, Assigned To, Priority, Due Date, Status, Comments.
    Attach photos, PDFs, and checklists to work orders.
    Implement real-time updates using WebSockets (Socket.io).

Deliverables:

    /api/work-orders (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    UI: Work Order List, Work Order Detail View
    Real-time status updates via WebSockets

4Ô∏è‚É£ Asset & Inventory Management (Week 7-9)

    Create assets (machines, equipment, tools) with unique IDs.
    Store asset location, specifications, maintenance history.
    Implement inventory tracking for spare parts & consumables.

Deliverables:

    /api/assets (CRUD operations for assets)
    /api/inventory (Track available spare parts)
    UI: Asset List, Asset Details, Inventory Dashboard

5Ô∏è‚É£ Preventive Maintenance Scheduling (Week 10-12)

    Automate recurring maintenance tasks based on:
        Time-based (every X days/weeks/months)
        Usage-based (after X machine hours)
    Integrate calendar view for maintenance schedules.
    Send automated reminders via email, SMS, or push notifications.

Deliverables:

    /api/maintenance (Manage maintenance schedules)
    UI: Calendar View, Preventive Maintenance List

6Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting & Analytics (Week 13-14)

    Generate reports on:
        Work Order Completion Rates
        Asset Downtime Trends
        Inventory Consumption Analytics
    Implement role-based dashboards for managers and technicians.

Deliverables:

    /api/reports (Generate & export reports)
    UI: Dashboard with KPIs and charts

7Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Site Management & User Access Control (Week 15-16)

    Support multiple locations/sites with independent asset & work order tracking.
    Admins can assign users to specific sites with different permissions.

Deliverables:

    /api/sites (Manage multiple facilities)
    UI: Site Selection, Site Management

8Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Scaling (Week 17-18)

    Optimize API for high concurrency (using Redis for caching).
    Deploy to AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean / Kubernetes for scalability.
    Set up logging & monitoring using Prometheus + Grafana.

Deliverables:

    Dockerized deployment
    CI/CD pipeline
    Monitoring dashboards

üìå Development Guidelines

    Follow a modular approach: Keep backend APIs RESTful, structured under /api/v1/.
    Write unit & integration tests: Use Jest (for Node.js), Cypress (for frontend).
    Ensure high security: Enforce input validation, API rate limiting, CORS policies.
    Use real-time updates wisely: WebSockets only where necessary (e.g., live work order status).
